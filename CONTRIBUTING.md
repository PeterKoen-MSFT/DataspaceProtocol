## Eclipse Contributor Agreement

Before your contribution can be accepted by the project, you need to create and electronically sign an [Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA)](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/ecafaq.php):

1. Log in to the [Eclipse foundation website](https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/login/). You will need to create an account within the Eclipse Foundation if you have not already done so.
2. Click on "Eclipse ECA", and complete the form.

_Note: Be sure to use the same email address in your Eclipse Account that you intend to use when you commit to GitHub._

## How to Contribute

### Discuss

If you want to share an idea to further enhance the project or discuss potential use cases, please feel free to create a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base/DataspaceProtocol/discussions).

If you feel there is a bug or an issue, contribute to the discussions in **existing issues**, otherwise [create a new issue](#create-an-issue).

### Create an Issue

If you have identified a bug or want to formulate a working item that you want to concentrate on, feel free to create a new issue at the repository's corresponding [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base/DataspaceProtocol/issues).

**Before doing so, please consider searching for potentially suitable [existing issues](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base/DataspaceProtocol/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).**

We also use [GitHub's default label set](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) extended by custom ones to classify issues and improve findability.

If an issue appears to cover changes that will have a (huge) impact on the specification and needs to first be discussed, or if you just have a question regarding the usage of the protocols, please create a discussion _before_ raising an issue.

Please note that if an issue covers a topic or the response to a question that may be interesting for other contributors or for further discussions, it should be converted to a discussion and not be closed.

### Submit a Pull Request

In addition to the contribution guideline made available in the [Eclipse project handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#contributing), we would appreciate if your pull request (PR) applies to the following points.

* Conform to the [PR Etiquette](PR_ETIQUETTE.md).
 
* Always apply the following copyright header to specific files in your work replacing the fields enclosed by curly brackets "{}" with your own identifying information. (Don't include the curly brackets!) Enclose the text in the appropriate comment syntax for the file format.

    ```text
    Copyright (c) {year} {owner}[ and others]

* The git commit messages should comply to the following format:
    ```
    <prefix>(<scope>): <description>
    ```

  Use the [imperative mood](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches)  as in "fix bug" or "add feature" (lower case at the beginning) rather than "fixed bug" or "added feature" and [mention the GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).

  All committers and all commits, are bound to the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/DCO.php). As such, all parties involved in a contribution must have valid ECAs. Additionally, commits can include a ["Signed-off-by" entry](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Contributing_via_Git).

* PR descriptions should use the current [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

* Submit a draft PR at early-stage and add people previously working on the same content as reviewer. Make sure automatic checks pass before marking it as "ready for review":

    * _Intellectual Property Validation_ verifying the [Eclipse CLA](#eclipse-contributor-agreement) has been signed as well as commits have been signed-off.
    * _Prevent Changes to Release Files_ checks if old release documents have been changed unintentionally.

## EF Project Roles

The [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#roles) defines roles for projects such as _Committer_ and _Contributor_.

### Contributor

### Committer

#### Privileges & Responsibilities

* Committers have the rights t

#### Special Role: Normative Editor

Usually, a specification project has some appointed editors that take care of formatting 

#### Becoming a Committer

Committers are either appointed at the time of project creation, or elected by the existing project team. For becoming a committer, you need to have a proven track record, covering significant contribution like:

* Demonstrated expertise in the project
* History of quality contributions
* Community involvement in the GitHub Issues or Discussions section

The committer election process will always be initiated by existing Committers. They will contact you and ask for the willingness to fulfil the Committer rights and obligations.

The official EF Committer election process is started by the project lead and follows a democratic voting process. A list of active committers is available on the [project page](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.dataspace-protocol-base/who).

#### Retirement of Committers
